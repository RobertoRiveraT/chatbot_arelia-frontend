        '<h2>Project Overview</h2>' + 
        '<p>Hero’s Warden is a unique action-combat prototype where players assume the role of a sentient weapon guiding a vulnerable hero through dangerous dungeons. Unlike traditional control schemes, the player directly controls the weapon, seamlessly switching between different forms — sword, axe, bow, and wand — adapting to each combat encounter while protecting the hero from harm.</p>' +

        '<h2>Gameplay Design Contributions</h2>' +
        '<ul>' +
        '<li><strong>Combat Mechanics:</strong> Designed and implemented responsive hack-and-slash mechanics including hit detection, attack combos, and form switching.</li>' +
        '<li><strong>Transformation System:</strong> Programmed the weapon transformation logic to allow real-time swapping between multiple weapon types with distinct attack patterns and strategic depth.</li>' +
        '<li><strong>Gameplay Loop:</strong> Balanced attack sequences, transformation cooldowns, and enemy behaviors to maintain challenging but fair progression.</li>' +
        '<li><strong>Object-Oriented Design:</strong> Utilized <strong>C# OOP principles</strong> for extensible weapon classes and enemy behavior controllers.</li>' +
        '</ul>' +

        '<h2>Game Jam Collaboration</h2>' +
        '<p>Worked in a fully remote, multidisciplinary team of 5 members, collaborating on:</p>' +
        '<ul>' +
        '<li><strong>Level Design & Background Art:</strong> Luis Macías</li>' +
        '<li><strong>Music & Sound Effects:</strong> Guillermo Isaac Jiménez Pinkus</li>' +
        '<li><strong>UI Design:</strong> Siddhartha López Valenzuela</li>' +
        '<li><strong>Combat Mechanics & Programming:</strong> Roberto Rivera Terán (myself)</li>' +
        '</ul>' +

        '<h2>Key Skills Applied</h2>' +
        '<p><strong>Unity Game Engine</strong>, <strong>C#</strong>, <strong>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</strong>, <strong>Real-time Prototyping</strong>, <strong>GitHub Version Control</strong>, <strong>Remote Agile Collaboration</strong>, <strong>Multidisciplinary teamwork</strong>, <strong>Game Design Iteration</strong>.</p>' +
