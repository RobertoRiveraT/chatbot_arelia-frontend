        'This portfolio website exemplifies my frontend engineering capabilities through a fully responsive, accessible, and modular interface built with <strong>Angular</strong>. It uses <strong>component-based architecture</strong> to enable scalability, code reuse, and clean separation of concerns across views and functionalities.' + 
        '</p>' + 
        '<p>' + 
        'The application demonstrates advanced <strong>stateful routing</strong> and <strong>JWT-based authentication</strong> using route guards, along with dynamic navigation flows based on user login status. Every route, including <code><strong>/chatbot/login</strong></code>, <code><strong>/chatbot/register</strong></code>, and <code><strong>/chatbot/chat</strong></code>, is protected and integrated with backend validation mechanisms.' + 
        '</p>' + 
        '<p>' + 
        'One of the signature features is the interactive chatbot demo, which lives in the <code><strong>/chatbot/chat</strong></code> route. The chatbot component dynamically builds and sends requests to protected endpoints like <code><strong>/chat</strong></code> and <code><strong>/chat-history</strong></code>, supporting a seamless user experience that mimics production-level behavior.' + 
        '</p>' + 
        '<p>' + 
        'To guide users, the interface implements an educational <strong>Tutorial Step System</strong> (Steps 1 to 4), where each screen visually explains the inner workings of the authentication flow, user registration, chatbot communication, and account management.' + 
        '</p>' + 
        '<p>' + 
        'The <code><strong>/mywork</strong></code> section displays dynamically filtered project and certification cards, each featuring collapsible descriptions, bullet points, thumbnails, and linked evidence; all styled and animated for modern UX standards. The entire UI is mobile-responsive, and optimized for both desktop and smaller screens.' + 
        '</p>' + 
        '<p>' + 
        'The codebase is version-controlled on GitHub and follows <strong>professional software delivery practices</strong>. It features a clean branching strategy using <strong>dev</strong>, <strong>qa-staging</strong>, and <strong>production</strong> branches, ensuring structured deployment pipelines and maintainability.' +
