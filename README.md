## ⚙️ Environment Configuration

This frontend uses dynamic environment variable generation to avoid hardcoding backend URLs.

### Used Variables

| Variable           | Purpose                            |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `NG_APP_BASE_URL`  | Backend URL depending on environment |

### Generated File

- `src/environments/env.ts` → Automatically generated by `scripts/write-env.ts`.

### Example `.env` and `.env.staging`

```env
# .env (production)
NG_APP_BASE_URL=https://chatbotarelia-backend-production.up.railway.app

# .env.staging (QA)
NG_APP_BASE_URL=https://backend-repo-qa-staging.up.railway.app
```

> 🔒 These files are ignored by Git and must be set manually for local and Vercel environments.

---

## 🚀 Useful Commands

### 🛠️ Local Development

```bash
npm install
ts-node scripts/write-env.ts && ng serve
```

> Generates `env.ts` before starting the dev server.

### 🧪 QA-Staging Build

```bash
ts-node scripts/write-env.ts && ng build --configuration=qa-staging
```

### 🏭 Production Build

```bash
ts-node scripts/write-env.ts && ng build --configuration=production
```

---

## ✅ Automatic Deployment

### QA

Every push to the `qa-staging` branch triggers an automatic deployment on Vercel using QA environment variables.

### Production

Every push to `main` (or `production`) branch triggers a production build.

---

## 🔐 Security

The frontend **does not** contain backend URLs directly in `.ts` files. URLs are injected through environment variables from:

- Local `.env` files
- Vercel’s environment variables per branch

---

## 🧼 Best Practices

- Do not commit `dist/`
- Ignore the generated `env.ts`
- Do not push `.env` or `.env.staging`
- Always run `ts-node scripts/write-env.ts` before `ng serve` or `ng build`

---

## 🧪 Testing

No unit tests yet, but Karma and Jasmine integration is planned.
